        The conversion rate of fastcash to usd is determined by a deterministic formula, in which the price of fastcash (denominated in eth), increases at a rate of 20% for 71 weeks after the initial launch (January of 2018). The conversion rate of usd to eth is determined by a trusted third party, and refreshed once at the begining of every week. The smallest denomination of fastcash is the MONEYBUCK, which is equivalent to 1 10e-18 fastcash. To determine the price of MONEYBUCKS relative to WEI, simply apply the following formula: ((4 * (10 ** (week + 18 - (10 + MAX(0, week - 15))))) / ( USDWEI / 10 ** 10 ) * ((12 ** week) / (10 ** MAX(0, week - 15)))) where all values of [week] are between 0 and 71 (inclusive).

        <h2>STEP 3.</h2>
        <h3>ACQUIRE ETHEREUM SO YOU CAN BUY YOUR FASTCASH</h3>
      </div>

      <p>FastCashMoneyPlus is a certified ERC20 Ethereum contract, and sits on top of the Ethereum BlockChain. This means: <strong>YOU NEED ETHEREUM</strong> to participate in the ICO.</p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 30px">
        <li>
          You can acquire Ethereum (ETH) on any number of exchanges. We reccomend <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" target="_blank">coinbase</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you're unsure how much ethereum to buy, <a href="#chooser"> CLICK HERE TO GO TO THE FASTCASH SELECTION TOOL</a> to get an estimate on how much you need.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="highlight">
        <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" target="_blank">CLICK HERE TO GO TO COINBASE TO BUY ETHEREUM</a>
      </h3>

      <p>After you've bought your Ethereum, (or if you already have Ethereum) please continue to the next step:</p>

      <div class="continueBox"><label class="confirmBox"><span class="highlight">--> <input id="ethBought" type="checkbox"> <--</span>CLICK THIS once you've bought your Etherem</label></div>

        <h2>STEP 4.</h2>
        <h3>TRANSFER ETHEREUM TO A WALLET</h3>
      </div>

      <p>You don't <em>TRUELY</em> own your crypto until you transfer it to a personal wallet. <strong>Applications like Coinbase are like a BANK</strong>, which means you only own as much crypto as THEY SAY you own. If you try to buy FastCash from coinbase, the FastCash ledger will think that Coinbase owns your FastCash. And being a bank, they will undoubtedly <strong>steal all of your FastCash without giving you the time of day!</strong></p>

      <h3 class="highlight">IF YOU TRY TO MAKE A FASTCASH TRANSACTION FROM COINBASE, THEY WILL STEAL YOUR FASTCASH. DO NOT MAKE A FASTCASH TRANSACTION FROM COINBASE!</h3>

      <p>In short, you need to transfer your Ethereum to a wallet YOU OWN, and then buy your FastCash.</p>

      <p>There are a few different ways you can set up a wallet.</p>
