    <h3>This table displays the current conversion rate:</h3>
    <div id="tableContainer"></div>
    <p class="tinyFont">
      The conversion rate of fastcash to usd is determined by a deterministic formula, in which the price of fastcash (denominated in eth), increases at a rate of 20% for 71 weeks after the initial launch (January of 2018). The conversion rate of usd to eth is determined by a trusted third party, and refreshed once at the begining of every week. The smallest denomination of fastcash is the MONEYBUCK, which is equivalent to 1 10e-18 fastcash. To determine the price of MONEYBUCKS relative to WEI, simply apply the following formula: ((4 * (10 ** (week + 18 - (10 + MAX(0, week - 15))))) / ( USDWEI / 10 ** 10 ) * ((12 ** week) / (10 ** MAX(0, week - 15)))) where all values of [week] are between 0 and 71 (inclusive).

      <h3>ACQUIRE ETHEREUM SO YOU CAN BUY YOUR FASTCASH</h3>

    <p>To make things easier on our investors, we chose to accept transactions in Ethereum. This means that you NEED ETHEREUM to buy your fastcash.</p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 30px">
      <li>
        You can acquire Ethereum (ETH) on any number of exchanges. We reccomend <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" target="_blank">coinbase</a>.

      <h2>STEP 4.</h2>
      <h3>TRANSFER ETHEREUM TO A WALLET</h3>
    </div>
    <p>To purchase fastcash, you need to send your ethereum to the FastCashMoneyPlus Contract from a dedicated wallet. The FastCashMoneyPlus Contract will identify your ethereum wallet as the true holder of your fastcash balance. HOWEVER, if you send the Contract ethereum from your coinbase account, then coinbase will own your fastcash instead of you. DON'T DO THIS</p>
    <h3 class="highlight">DO NOT MAKE A FASTCASH TRANSACTION FROM COINBASE OR ELSE YOU WILL LOSE YOUR ETHEREUM AND YOUR FASTCASH!!!</h3>
