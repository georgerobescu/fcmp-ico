    <h3>This table displays the current conversion rate:</h3>
    <div id="tableContainer"></div>
    <p class="tinyFont">
      The conversion rate of fastcash to usd is determined by a deterministic formula, in which the price of fastcash (denominated in eth), increases at a rate of 20% for 71 weeks after the initial launch (January of 2018). The conversion rate of usd to eth is determined by a trusted third party, and refreshed once at the begining of every week. The smallest denomination of fastcash is the MONEYBUCK, which is equivalent to 1 10e-18 fastcash. To determine the price of MONEYBUCKS relative to WEI, simply apply the following formula: ((4 * (10 ** (week + 18 - (10 + MAX(0, week - 15))))) / ( USDWEI / 10 ** 10 ) * ((12 ** week) / (10 ** MAX(0, week - 15)))) where all values of [week] are between 0 and 71 (inclusive).
